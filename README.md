# Journalism-iOS

Everybody in class will create an iPhone application that uses the MapKit technology to build an application that shows individual locations (parks, trails, parking garages, museums, or anything else you like) as pins on the map. Use the Building Mapping Apps in iOS PDF in Modules under Programming Tutorials as a guide.
Your project should be a working Swift 3 iOS application that displays two or more locations on the map as pins.
To get credit for the assignment, you need to show your app to instructors in class, (on the iOS Simulator or on a device).
